# EBVA - Escuderia Brasileira de Veículos Autônomos

Welcome to **EBVA** (Escuderia Brasileira de Veículos Autônomos), a research group based in the **Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo (USP)**. The group operates under the guidance of the **Laboratório de Controle Aplicado (LCA)** and is dedicated to advancing the field of autonomous vehicles through research, development, and competition.



## Objectives
- Participate in **autonomous vehicle competitions** to test and showcase our technologies.
- Develop **state-of-the-art algorithms and software** for autonomous navigation, perception, and decision-making.
- Build and maintain robust **hardware platforms** for vehicle automation.
- Publish findings and promote knowledge-sharing within the academic and open-source communities.

## Areas of Focus
1. **Perception**: Sensor integration and data fusion for environment understanding.
2. **Localization**: High-accuracy positioning and mapping.
3. **Path Planning**: Real-time trajectory planning and optimization.
4. **Control Systems**: Robust control algorithms for vehicle stability and maneuvering.
